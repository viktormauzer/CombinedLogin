# CombinedLogin

One of the most common use cases for Combine framework is a form for user registration so I decided to create a small login/register app to showcase Combine framework in action.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run in Xcode.

## Details

This app doesn't send your login data to a server, it only validates the form using Combine framework. I'm using MVVM (a bit overkill, but it's just to show a common setup).

All views are setup programmatically using UIKit.
